1. Put sample emails from data folder into HDFS
2. Run hadoop job: 
   hadoop jar convertsearch.jar ConvertEmailsToSequence <sample email dir> <output dir>
   hadoop jar convertsearch.jar SearchEmail <sequence file dir> 
3. The sample data contains 1K .msg files (all copies) and the results in your /tmp dir should be identical to this
